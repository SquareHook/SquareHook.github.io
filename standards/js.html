<h2>
Always use semicolons.

Relying on implicit insertion can cause subtle, hard to debug problems. Don't do it. You're better than that.

There are a couple places where missing semicolons are particularly dangerous:
</h2>
<pre>
  <code class="javascript">
    // 1.
    MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
      return 42;
    }  // No semicolon here.
    
    (function() {
    // Some initialization code wrapped in a function to create a scope for locals.
    })();
    
    
    var x = {
      'i': 1,
      'j': 2
    }  // No semicolon here.
    
    // 2.  Trying to do one thing on Internet Explorer and another on Firefox.
    // I know you'd never write code like this, but throw me a bone.
    [ffVersion, ieVersion][isIE]();
    
    
    var THINGS_TO_EAT = [apples, oysters, sprayOnCheese]  // No semicolon here.
    
    // 3. conditional execution a la bash
    -1 == resultOfOperation() || die();
    
  </code>
</pre>
