<h3>
Always use semicolons.
</h3>

<h4>
Relying on implicit insertion can cause subtle, hard to debug problems. Don't do it. You're better than that.

There are a couple places where missing semicolons are particularly dangerous:
</h4>
<pre>
  <code class="javascript">
    // 1.
    MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
      return 42;
    }  // No semicolon here.
    
    (function() {
    // Some initialization code wrapped in a function to create a scope for locals.
    })();
    
    
    var x = {
      'i': 1,
      'j': 2
    }  // No semicolon here.
    
    // 2.  Trying to do one thing on Internet Explorer and another on Firefox.
    // I know you'd never write code like this, but throw me a bone.
    [ffVersion, ieVersion][isIE]();
    
    
    var THINGS_TO_EAT = [apples, oysters, sprayOnCheese]  // No semicolon here.
    
    // 3. conditional execution a la bash
    -1 == resultOfOperation() || die();
    
  </code>
</pre>

<h4>
  So what happens and why?
</h4>
<p>
  
    1. JavaScript error - first the function returning 42 is called with the second function as a parameter, then the number 42 is "called" resulting in an error.  <br>
    2. You will most likely get a 'no such property in undefined' error at runtime as it tries to call x[ffVersion, ieVersion][isIE]().  <br>
    3. die is always called since the array minus 1 is NaN which is never equal to anything (not even if resultOfOperation() returns NaN) and THINGS_TO_EAT gets assigned the result of die().  

</p>
<p>
    JavaScript requires statements to end with a semicolon, except when it thinks it can safely infer their existence. In each of these examples, a function declaration or object or array literal is used inside a statement. The closing brackets are not enough to signal the end of the statement. Javascript never ends a statement if the next token is an infix or bracket operator.
  
    This has really surprised people, so make sure your assignments end with semicolons.
</p>

<h3>Semicolons and Functions</h3>
<p>
  Clarification: 
  Semicolons should be included at the end of function expressions, but not at the end of function declarations. The distinction is best illustrated with an example:

</p>
<pre class="bg-success">
  <code>
    var foo = function() {
      return true;
    };  // semicolon here.
    
    function foo() {
      return true;
    }  // no semicolon here.
  </code>
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Function Declaration Within Code Blocks</h3>
<span class="text-danger">Bad: Don't Do This</span>
<pre>
  <code>
    if (x) {
      function foo() {}
    }
  </code>
</pre>

<h4>Why not? </h4>
<p>
  While most script engines support Function Declarations within blocks it is not part of ECMAScript (see ECMA-262, clause 13 and 14). Worse implementations are inconsistent with each other and with future EcmaScript proposals. ECMAScript only allows for Function Declarations in the root statement list of a script or function. Instead use a variable initialized with a Function Expression to define a function within a block:
</p>
<br>

<h3>Method and Property Definitions</h3>
<p>
  While there are several ways to attach methods and properties to an object created via "new", the preferred style for methods is:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    Foo.prototype.bar = function() {
      /* ... */
    };
    
    //The preferred style for other properties is to initialize the field in the constructor:
    /** @constructor */
    function Foo() {
      this.bar = value;
    }
  </code>
</pre>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>
  Current JavaScript engines optimize based on the "shape" of an object, adding a property to an object (including overriding a value set on the prototype) changes the shape and can degrade performance.
