<h2> C# Coding Standards</h2>
<h3>Comments </h3>
<p>
    Comments should be placed throughout your code, especially in areas that are not easily understood at a glance. At the bare minimum, you should write a comment above each method. Use triple forward slashes to generate a comment that will show in Visual Studio auto-complete.

<pre>
    <code class="C#">
        /// <summary>
        /// Return a list of stages that products can be in
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>JSON object showing stages</returns>
        public async Task<JsonResult> GetStages()
        {
            string message = "successful call to GetStages";
            bool success = true;
            var results = new List<Stage>();
            try
            {
